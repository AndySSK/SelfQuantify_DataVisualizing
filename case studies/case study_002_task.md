##ScatteredPointsPlot: Drawing with Data 1

Imagine that you have been commissioned to create a live
financial tracking graph. You need to track 100 fictional
stocks on both their market value and their volatility,
which are updated once per second. When a stock is high
on both market value and volatility, thus placing it in
a "critical quadrant," then you need to make it stand out
so appropriate action can be taken.

In addition, place text on the graph that counts how
many stocks are in the critical quadrant.

For purposes of this exercise, the stocks are fictional.
The market value and volatility are both random that
change randomly over time. You do not need to label the
stocks but you do need to highlight them somehow when 
they are above criterion values that you choose.
